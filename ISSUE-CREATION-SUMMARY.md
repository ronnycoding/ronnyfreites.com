## Creating Issues in GitHub

### Option 1: Manual Creation (Recommended for First Time)

Use the guide in `GITHUB-ISSUES-CREATION-GUIDE.md`:

```bash
# 1. Create epic
gh issue create \
  --title "[EPIC] Next.js Portfolio Website - Complete Redesign" \
  --body-file EPIC-PORTFOLIO-REDESIGN.md \
  --label "epic,enhancement,high-priority" \
  --assignee ronnycoding

# Note the epic number (e.g., #100)

# 2. Create first sub-issue
gh issue create \
  --title "[SUB-ISSUE #1] Foundation - Project Setup" \
  --body-file SUB-ISSUE-01-PROJECT-SETUP.md \
  --label "foundation,critical,phase-1" \
  --assignee ronnycoding

# 3. Repeat for other sub-issues
```

### Option 2: Bulk Creation Script

Create `create-all-issues.sh`:
```bash
#!/bin/bash

# See GITHUB-ISSUES-CREATION-GUIDE.md for full script
# This will create all 26 issues in one command
```

### Option 3: GitHub Web Interface

1. Go to https://github.com/ronnycoding/ronnyfreites.com/issues
2. Click "New Issue"
3. Copy/paste content from markdown files
4. Add labels manually
5. Assign yourself
6. Create issue

## Monitoring Progress
