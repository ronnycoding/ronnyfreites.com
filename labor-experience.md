As a Senior Software Engineer at LoudCrowd, I have been instrumental in architecting and maintaining a mission-critical enterprise serverless platform that processes millions of e-commerce events and transactions daily. My role encompasses full-stack development with a particular focus on GraphQL optimization, third-party integrations, and scalable system architecture.

In the realm of third-party integrations, I spearheaded the development and enhancement of the Impact Affiliate Network e-commerce integration, a critical system for processing affiliate marketing data. This involved building robust web event processing pipelines capable of handling 45+ days of historical data with sophisticated error handling and automated retry mechanisms. The integration processes high-volume transaction data in real-time, requiring careful attention to rate limiting, data validation, and system reliability.

I also architected and built a comprehensive creator/ambassador platform that serves as the backbone for influencer marketing operations. This system includes dynamic tracking link generation, real-time analytics dashboards, and commission calculation engines. The platform features an innovative expandable widget system with multiple positioning options, allowing creators to seamlessly integrate product links into their content across various platforms.

Throughout my tenure, I have consistently focused on performance optimization, implementing advanced database query strategies and developing intelligent product sorting algorithms that prioritize user experience. My work has directly contributed to improved system reliability, enhanced user engagement, and increased revenue generation through more effective affiliate marketing tools.As a Senior Software Engineer at LoudCrowd, I have been instrumental in architecting and maintaining a mission-critical enterprise serverless platform that processes millions of e-commerce events and transactions daily.

As a Senior React Developer at Gorilla Logic, I played a pivotal role in the transformation of a legacy .NET system into a modern, serverless architecture using AWS Lambda functions and a ReactJS web client application. One of my primary responsibilities was to migrate the existing legacy layout in .NET Core to React and implement serverless functions, particularly for a Grant Management system at Submittable, where I was engaged as an outsourcing consultant of Gorilla Logic.

Collaborating closely with the development team, I led the strategic planning and execution of this migration, addressing both business requirements and technical challenges. Concurrently, I took on a mentoring role, providing valuable insights to less experienced developers on project expectations and best practices for building scalable and maintainable systems.

Leveraging my expertise in ReactJS, I crafted the web client application utilizing modern tools such as Hooks, Context API, and Redux for effective state and data flow management. Additionally, I played a key role in integrating the web client with AWS Lambda functions, utilizing APIs and other technologies to create a seamless and reliable system.

Beyond migration tasks, I actively contributed to the modernization of the front-end using React and implemented Payoneer for fund withdrawals. I also facilitated the collection of funds from programs managed by the Submittable platform.

Taking a holistic approach, I engaged in unit testing using Jest and React Testing Library to ensure the stability and flawless performance of the system. This involved creating and maintaining a series of unit tests.As a Senior React Developer at Gorilla Logic, I played a pivotal role in the transformation of a legacy .NET system into a modern, serverless architecture using AWS Lambda functions and a ReactJS web client application.

As the Technical Lead overseeing a small team of six full-stack developers, I took charge of spearheading the development of a payment gateway project. This involved orchestrating its seamless integration with external payment systems and a mobile application. My role encompassed designing the architecture for both the backend, written in TypeScript and utilizing Node.js, and the frontend, developed using React Native. The entire platform was constructed on Amazon Web Services (AWS), with a focus on optimizing performance through the utilization of AWS Lambda functions and efficient infrastructure management via the Serverless.com tool.

A notable achievement was the successful implementation of a payment solution based on QR code generation, specifically tailored for retail-level payment reception.
Beyond technical aspects, my responsibilities extended to strategic decision-making as a Tech Lead. I mentored the team, guiding them through complex technical challenges and fostering a collaborative learning environment.

Architectural decisions, including the design of new features and functionalities for the payment gateway, were pivotal aspects of my role. This involved not only envisioning innovative solutions but also ensuring an optimal user experience. In addition to hands-on development, I led and coordinated the team's efforts in implementing new features, emphasizing collaboration and continuous learning. I actively participated in meetings with the product team to gather requirements and design solutions, contributing to the overall project vision. This included planning sessions and ticket elaboration for the project's execution, demonstrating a commitment to structured and effective project management.As the Technical Lead overseeing a small team of six full-stack developers, I took charge of spearheading the development of a payment gateway project.
