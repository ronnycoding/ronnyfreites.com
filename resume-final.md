## Professional Experience

### Senior Software Engineer
**LoudCrowdDev** | *March 2022 - Present*

As a Senior Software Engineer at LoudCrowdDev, I have been instrumental in architecting and maintaining a mission-critical enterprise serverless platform that processes millions of e-commerce events and transactions daily. My role encompasses full-stack development with a particular focus on GraphQL optimization, third-party integrations, and scalable system architecture.

One of my most significant achievements was resolving a complex product variant mapping inconsistency that was causing data integrity issues across multiple GraphQL resolvers. The challenge involved ambassador product feeds returning different product-variant relationships compared to URL-based product lookups due to intricate fallback logic. I solved this by implementing a sophisticated GraphQL fragment architecture, creating reusable ProductVariantForm fragments that ensure consistent data structures across all resolvers. This solution not only eliminated the immediate data mismatches but also established a pattern for future schema consistency.

In the realm of third-party integrations, I spearheaded the development and enhancement of the Impact Radius e-commerce integration, a critical system for processing affiliate marketing data. This involved building robust web event processing pipelines capable of handling 45+ days of historical data with sophisticated error handling and automated retry mechanisms. The integration processes high-volume transaction data in real-time, requiring careful attention to rate limiting, data validation, and system reliability.

I also architected and built a comprehensive creator/ambassador platform that serves as the backbone for influencer marketing operations. This system includes dynamic tracking link generation, real-time analytics dashboards, and commission calculation engines. The platform features an innovative expandable widget system with multiple positioning options, allowing creators to seamlessly integrate product links into their content across various platforms.

Throughout my tenure, I have consistently focused on performance optimization, implementing advanced database query strategies and developing intelligent product sorting algorithms that prioritize user experience. My work has directly contributed to improved system reliability, enhanced user engagement, and increased revenue generation through more effective affiliate marketing tools.

### Founder & Lead Developer
**ShipEase Commerce** | *May 2024 - Present*

As the Founder and Lead Developer of ShipEase Commerce, I conceived and built a comprehensive e-commerce ecosystem from the ground up, transforming an initial concept into a fully operational platform within eight months. This entrepreneurial venture required me to wear multiple hats, serving as both the technical architect and hands-on developer while making critical business and technology decisions.

The platform's architecture centers around a TypeScript-based ecosystem that spans multiple touchpoints: a responsive web application, a React Native mobile app, and scalable backend services. I chose TypeScript throughout the stack to ensure type safety and maintainability as the platform scales. The web application, deployed on Vercel, features modern e-commerce functionality including product catalogs, shopping cart management, and integrated payment processing.

One of the most challenging aspects was developing the mobile application using React Native with Expo SDK. This required careful consideration of offline capabilities, QR code functionality for product scanning, and seamless synchronization with the backend services. I implemented a robust state management system that handles both online and offline scenarios, ensuring users can browse products and manage their cart even without internet connectivity.

Recognizing the importance of international markets, I implemented comprehensive Spanish localization throughout the platform, including not just translation but cultural adaptation of user interface elements, payment methods, and customer service workflows. This involved creating a flexible internationalization system that can easily accommodate additional languages and regions as the business grows.

The backend architecture leverages modern serverless principles with TypeScript APIs that handle everything from inventory management to order processing and customer notifications. I integrated Google Analytics for comprehensive tracking and implemented automated deployment pipelines that ensure reliable, zero-downtime updates to the production environment.

### Senior Software Engineering Consultant
**Freelance** | *9+ Years*

Throughout my freelance consulting career, I have partnered with diverse organizations ranging from Fortune 500 companies to innovative startups, delivering custom software solutions that address complex business challenges. My consulting approach focuses on understanding each client's unique requirements and translating them into scalable, maintainable technology solutions.

One of my most notable engagements was with Marriott Worldwide, where I developed custom WordPress solutions for their enterprise-level content management needs. This project required deep integration with their existing systems, custom theme development, and performance optimization to handle high-traffic loads across multiple international properties. The challenge involved creating a flexible content management system that could accommodate different regional requirements while maintaining brand consistency and optimal performance.

My e-commerce specialization has led to numerous successful Shopify integrations, where I've built custom applications that extend the platform's native capabilities. These projects typically involve complex payment gateway integrations, inventory management systems, and custom checkout flows that enhance the customer experience while providing businesses with the operational tools they need. One particularly challenging project involved creating a multi-vendor marketplace with custom commission tracking and automated payout systems.

In the mobile development space, I've created several cross-platform React Native applications integrated with AWS cloud services. These projects often require real-time features such as push notifications, live chat functionality, and offline data synchronization. I've developed applications for industries ranging from healthcare to logistics, each requiring careful attention to security, performance, and user experience across both iOS and Android platforms.

My consulting work has taught me the importance of clear communication, thorough documentation, and knowledge transfer. I consistently work closely with client teams to ensure smooth project handoffs and provide training when needed, establishing long-term relationships that often lead to additional engagements and referrals.

### Community Leader & Technical Organizer
**CostaRicaJS** | *2014 - Present*

As a co-founder and long-standing leader of CostaRicaJS, I have dedicated over a decade to nurturing and growing Costa Rica's JavaScript developer community. This role emerged from recognizing the need for a centralized hub where local developers could connect, share knowledge, and collaborate on advancing the JavaScript ecosystem in Central America.

My primary contribution has been creating and maintaining educational resources that serve developers at all skill levels. The "Fundamentos de JavaScript" project represents a comprehensive learning path that I developed to address the specific needs of Spanish-speaking developers in our region. This resource covers everything from basic programming concepts to advanced JavaScript patterns, with practical examples and exercises tailored to the local development landscape.

Beyond educational content creation, I have consistently served as a speaker at WordPress WordCamp events and other technical conferences throughout the region. These speaking engagements allow me to share practical insights from my professional experience while staying connected with emerging trends and challenges in the developer community. Topics I've covered range from modern JavaScript frameworks to best practices in full-stack development.

The community's technical infrastructure requires ongoing maintenance and evolution, responsibilities I've embraced throughout my leadership tenure. This includes managing our GitHub organization, maintaining community websites, and organizing online and in-person events. During the pandemic, I helped transition our events to virtual formats, ensuring continuity of learning and networking opportunities for our members.

Perhaps most importantly, I've focused on mentorship and career development within the community. I regularly provide guidance to junior developers, help connect community members with job opportunities, and facilitate knowledge sharing between experienced and emerging developers. This mentorship extends through my personal platform at RonnyFreites.com, where I offer more detailed resources and one-on-one guidance.
